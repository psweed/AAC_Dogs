    "The Austin Animal Center publishes daily data containing shelter animals processed through the shelter, various characteristics of the animal, and their outcomes. This notebook is used to clean the data in a format used for analysis. Note feature engineering is applied to the data. <br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that there is a lot of data given that couldn't possible be known when an animal is processed into the animal shelter e.g. the day and time of the outcome. Although these can be useful pieces of information (e.g. during what month are adoptions most likely to happen?), we will focus our analysis on characteristics of the dog that would be known near the time of intake. We do wish that the day and time the animal was processed into the shelter was provided."
